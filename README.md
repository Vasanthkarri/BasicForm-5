*	 In this project I learned Basic Form creation
*creating a Basic input form values and whenever the values are "Initial Values"
are empty. we couldn't change with out using onChange
Handler in input tag
* With the help of 'event.target.value' we will get the onScreen Values
*with the use of ternary operator we checked if the firstname,
lastname and email are empty. it will show {"please enter first name"} as an "error"
